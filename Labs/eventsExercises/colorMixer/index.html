    <!-- This is an application that will start a div at a black color, and as a user presses buttons associated with RGB, the div will change to new colors. The button presses should affect additively - that is. If a div is currently blue, pressing +red buttons will change the div to a purple color.

    9 buttons (associated with red green and blue). There should be a +1, +5, and +10 button for each color.
    1 div that will change colors to the rgb color calculated

    1 div that shows the current calculated rgb color

    You must use attributes on the buttons for the values to change the colors by. -->
